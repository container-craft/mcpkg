These are basic implementations of standard cryptography algorithms, written by Brad Conte (brad@bradconte.com) from scratch and without any cross-licensing. They exist to provide publically accessible, restriction-free implementations of popular cryptographic algorithms, like AES and SHA-1


We needed sha1 and md5sum so thanks again Brad,
